So, I’ve got this dual-screen setup, but whenever I’m only using one screen—like for coding, watching a movie, or whatever—I usually just throw on blackscreen.app to keep the second one dark. Then I thought, why not make my own version and throw in a time feature?

And here we are! You can totally use it for whatever you need too.
